## Preliminaries
### Data

All the graphs of this series are generated from data concerning frequency with which words from assorted dictionaries appear in original reddit posts from various subreddits. 

The first dataset, called `allsubs` includes 5 columns : 

1. `subreddit` the name of one of ~120k subreddits
1. `posts` a count of (qualifying\footnote{only posts of 100+ words in length, marked as 'self' posts, ie. user generated text, not external links were counted in this data collection}) posts in each subreddit
1. `wordcount` a sum of the total number of words in all posts in that subreddit
1.  `abscount` a sum of the total number of 'absolutist'\footnote{Examples of absolutist words are: `always', `never', `completely', etc. For definitions and selection process of `absolutist' words, see: \href{http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2167702617747074}{In an Absolute State}  by AlMosaiwi and Johnstone (2018)} words in posts  
1. `freq` the frequency of absolutist words in qualifying posts, calculated as $$\frac{number\ of\ absolutist\ words}{number\ of\ total\ words}$$


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
allsubs <- read_tsv(here('static','data','redditProject','output.tsv'))
```
### Audience


In its current form, audience for this project is almost entirely myself and the professors I'm trying to convince to help me with this project. Eventually I hope to research may be of interest to a larger group, including: 

1. Linguists interested in this method of textual analysis and the language of internet forums
1. Computer sciencists interested in the distributed computing or machine learning that went into this project
1. Social scientists studying any of the many social groups involved on reddit. 

## Plot Type: Bar

### How to read it and what to look for 
This is a simple bar chart. It shows discrete categories on the x-axis and continuous values on the y-axis. In this case, I am also using color to represent the groups that categories fall into. I'm sorting the categories on the x-axis by values because there is no natural order to the categories.

### Presentation Tips
Audiences are mostly familiar with the bar chart. Calling out axes labels and identifying color labels are important to the chart. 

### Variations and Alternatives
Visually identical but conceptually different is the histogram, which using the same visual elements shows the distribution of a single variable, so the values of that variable would then be on the x-axis and the count of the number of elements having that value on the y-axis. In this case, we're comparing multiple categories rather than different values in a single category. Frequently numeric representation of the bars is included above the bars; bars are labeled with their numeric values, with the absolute values of the graphs being more important than the comparision between groups.

## Plot Description

### Representaton 

* Simple Bar Chart (best for showing relative magnitude)
  + Original features (dictionary frequency) on x axis
  + Magnitude of correlation with principal component on y axis 
  + Sorted by correlation between PC and dictionary
* Accompanied by radar chart showing how the components were used to cluster subreddits
